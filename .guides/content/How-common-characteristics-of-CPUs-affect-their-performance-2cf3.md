In this lesson we will look at how the speed at which the CPU processes instructions is affected by hardware and how it can be increased.

Everyone wants their computer to run more quickly. It is frustrating having to sit around while it is processing a very large image or backing up data.
The speed of processing is limited by the slowest component in the cycle. Even if the processor is very fast the rate of processing is limited by the speed of the RAM supplying the instructions.
Over the years manufacturers have developed technology and techniques to increase processing speed.
