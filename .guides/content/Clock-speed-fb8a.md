The rate at which instructions are processed is controlled by the clock speed. 
The faster the clock speed, the faster the rate of processing as a new instruction will start processing on each tick of the clock.
Clock speeds have increased and a rate of 3 GHz is common in modern home computer processors.

Continually increasing the clock speed has limitations:
The instructions are processed by transistors and the rate at which they operate is limited.
The processor generates a large amount of heat and this increases as the clock speed increases. A fan and heat sink are used to dissipate the heat to prevent it from malfunctioning or even melting but there are limits to the rate of cooling.
